Do you have any questions you specifically want to explore?

Could you imagine building a user-facing Dashboard with this dataset?

Over the recent years, many reports have surfaced ranking countries by their happiness index. Although there are many factors that contribute to a person's individual happiness, we want to determine the macroscopic characteristics a country may possess which lead to a happier population. We would like to determine if health factors or financial fators are a stronger predictor of happiness. Using country specific data, we want to explore the connections between happiness and various indicators. This investigation may enlighten us and provide valuable insight into helping individuals determine where they would like to reside. This would make an interesting dashboard since we can create a world map with all our statistics.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

*Who: Which company/agency/organization provided this data?*
- The world Happiness Report was downloaded from Kaggle and originated from the Gallup World Poll. 
All Health related indicator data is directly from the WHO. 

*What: What is in your data?*
- All our Data is in CSV format and includes the country, year of relevance, and indicator statistics. 

*When: When was your data collected (for example, for which years)?*

*Why: What is the purpose of your dataset? Is it for transparency/accountability, public interest, fun, learning, etcâ€¦*
- The happiness report is often used for policy making and civil society
- WHO information is importance for policy, large institutions, health research, learning, among other important reasons

*How: How was your data collected? Was it a human collecting the data? Historical records digitized? Server logs?*
- The Gallup World Poll interviews people directly and works with partnering organizations to collect data. The WHO has a Global Health Observatory data repository that mainly derives data from population-based sources (household surveys, civil registration systems of vital events) and institution-based sources (administrative and operational activities of institutions).

We will be using the [World Happiness Report 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021) in conjuction with health and financial indicators.

We would like to explore how these datasets may connect to a country's happiness index.
