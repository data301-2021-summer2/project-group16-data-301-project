Over the recent years, many reports have surfaced ranking countries by their happiness index. Although there are many factors that contribute to a person's individual happiness, we want to determine the macroscopic characteristics a country may possess which lead to a happier population. Using country specific data, we want to explore the connections between happiness and various factors. This investigation may enlighten us and provide valuable insight into helping individuals determine where they would like to reside. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

We will be using the [World Happiness Report 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021) in conjuction with the following:
