This is where we will put the clean and processed data that we used to generate graphs and our dashboard

h_alco is the happiness of each country and their alcohol consumption

h_ind_merges is the happiness of each country and all the health indicators merged into one csv

h_ind_merged_noalco is the happiness of each country and all the health indicators merged into one csv but no alco (csv format was weird when combined)
